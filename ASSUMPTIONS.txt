3. Once a user registers, he/she is logged in automatically in the system and ready to play
4. New users are set with an initial balance of 50 Euro
5. Some html, css and logo where borrowed from casinoeuro

DE-POC2:

DE-POC5:

2. No client side and server side validation are done up to this moment.

DE-POC6:
1. The functionality to add a coin by Backend Users is not yet impmented though Apache Shiro
is fully configured and everything the backend already supports this.
2. The coins present in the system are loaded post Spring autowiring from the Security Controller
and so logged in users can still bet on the outcome of flipped coins.

DE-POC7 to DE-POC9:

Presently for users to be given this functionality, these should be inserted directly in the databse
2. No login screen for backoffice users.

Other assumptions:
----------------------
1. Users of FlipEuro may deposit money only via credit cards.
2. They cannot load the credit card details used for past transactions, but the system will check if card details with the same number exist and overwrite.
3. If a user posts credit card number belonging to another registered user the system gives an error.
4. Remember me functionality not supported in this scope.
5. When registering from the website the customer will be given a "normal" role
